# Intermittent Failure in NextAuth Session Check within API Route

This repository demonstrates a bug where session checking with NextAuth within an API route intermittently fails.  The issue does not consistently reproduce but manifests as unexpected 401 Unauthorized responses when a user is actually logged in.

## Bug Description

The API route uses `unstable_getServerSession` to verify user authentication. However, the session check is unreliable, occasionally returning `null` even when a valid session exists. This leads to the API returning a 401 response, preventing authorized users from accessing the route.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Log in using your preferred provider.
5. Make a request to `/api/auth`.  You'll likely see inconsistent responses (200/401).

## Solution

The provided solution in `api/auth.solution.js` addresses the bug by adding robust error handling and logging to the session check.  It includes additional checks and retries to mitigate the intermittent nature of the issue. This ensures a more reliable authentication process.
